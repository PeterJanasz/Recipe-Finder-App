# Recipe Finder App

## Coded By: Peter Janasz, Josh Hill, Weston Kostura, Carlos Ogle

## Description
Created a Recipe Finder App that pulls recipes based off of user input selection. Selection categories include Diet, Cuisine Type, Meal Type, and Health Label. Based off user preferences, the Edamam API will load 10 recipies for the user to choose from. Once the recipes load, the user can click on the picture to take them to the recipe link which includes ingredients and recipe instructions. The user also has an option to add a recipe to their favorites page. 

The website loads a random food gif in the hero section using the Giphy API.
Used Bulma for CSS framework to create style display and dropdown selections. The website is also responsive on multiple screen views.
